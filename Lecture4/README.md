# Smoothing exercise

After generating and smearing the data as illustrated in the exercise, Scipy `convolute` is used to smooth them, considering a gaussian kernel.
Several values of the parameter sigma were tested: here we plot two, showing that lower values of sigma result in smaller smoothing effects.
