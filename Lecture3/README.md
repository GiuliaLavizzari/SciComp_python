## CMS ECAL payload during 2024 data-taking
ECAL is divided into the barrel (the cylindrical part of the detector wrapped around the collision point) and the endcaps (the "corks" at the two ends of the cylinder).
The barrel is further divided into two halves, named as "plus" and "minus".

The following plots show the data payload (kB) in each partition. Points were sampled every 30 minutes, throughout 2024 data-taking.
The "hole" in june is the so-called "Machine Development", i.e. a period of about a week during which LHC does not deliver beam and therefore there is no data available.
