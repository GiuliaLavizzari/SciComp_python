Exam - Scientific Computing in python


## Lecture 1 - python interface to Oracle DB
The exercise contains a class ([DbInterface](https://github.com/GiuliaLavizzari/SciComp_python/blob/09459dc00b621f894b7a7fcb1f8f6fb99c8d673b/Lecture1/DbInterface.py)), which allows to interact with an oracle DB built for the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) upgrade for the High-Luminosity phase of the LHC.
It also contains a set of [utilities](https://github.com/GiuliaLavizzari/SciComp_python/tree/09459dc00b621f894b7a7fcb1f8f6fb99c8d673b/Lecture1/scripts) for quick operations on the db, such as printing or deleting tables.

The original code is hosted on CERN gitlab ([pyoracle](https://gitlab.cern.ch/ecal-daq-upgrade/pyoracle)).
