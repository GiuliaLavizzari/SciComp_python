# Exercise 1 - evaluating a function
The function $`f(x) = xe^{-x} + x(1-x)`$ is evaluated in the requested points. The result is the following:
|x    | y        |
|-----|----------|
|0    | 0        |
|0.1  | 0.180484 |
|0.2  | 0.323746 |
|0.4  | 0.508128 |
|0.8  | 0.519463 |

# Exercise 3 - integral and derivative
First, integrate the function $`f(x)`$:

$f(x) = sin(x) e^{-x}$

This gives the function $`i(x)`$:

$i(x) = -\frac{1}{2} e^{-x} \left(cos(x) + sin(x)\right)$

By computing the derivative of i(x) and by Simplifying it one obtains again f(x).

The two functions are shown in the following figure:
