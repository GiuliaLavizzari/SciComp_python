# PR to scientificcomputing_bicocca_2023
I added a [PR to remove an attachment](https://github.com/dgerosa/scientificcomputing_bicocca_2023/pull/12) that was missing (it was preventing the notebook from showing).

# Project under version control (git)
The project I'm working on that was not under version control is this exam, which is now here on github! 

(In my usual work life I use mainly gitlab, as I mainly work on CERN projects hosted there.)

# Additional: github pages fix
I created a github page about two years ago, for a "digital" poster session in which I took part. We were asked not to print our poster, and instead of showing a standard poster in pdf I created a single-page website hosted on github pages (extremely simple). As I didn't really know how to use git, I created it under `https://giulialavizzari.github.io/`. While I was reading the lectures I decided it was time to fix this and moved it to a more proper url (namely `https://giulialavizzari.github.io/VAE-ACAT2023/`). Now my poster displays [there](https://giulialavizzari.github.io/VAE-ACAT2023/), and there is room for improving my "personal page" with for example CV info.
